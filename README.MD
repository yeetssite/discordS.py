# Meet the spy!

He's not much at the moment, but he is a simple message logger. He's meant for:

1. The memes
2. Learning some discord.py stuff
3. Message logging(sorta)

He's also a **work-in-progress**, so he's not exactly feature-rich.

This bot is currently in the `alpha` stage, specifically `v1.0.0-alpha`.

Want to see something added? Make an issue, and it could happen!  
Pull requests are also cool, if you have experience with [discord.py](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py), just explain what the pr is about and what its code does.

This project was originally just some Discord API trolling, and learning about Discord's API and how to interact with it, but now it's some bs repo on GitHub, lol.
